# Universal Language Project

The Universal Language Project aims to develop a constructed language that can serve as a universal means of communication worldwide. This repository is open to contributions from all—your ideas, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!

## Design Goals

Our language is guided by four core principles:

**Simplicity:** The language is designed to be easy to learn and use for people of all ages and backgrounds.  
**Inclusiveness:** It reflects concepts and terminology from diverse cultures and regions.  
**Evolving Vocabulary:** The language will adapt over time through a community-driven process for introducing new terms.  
**Accessibility:** Documentation and learning materials will be available in multiple languages to lower participation barriers.

## Current Status

We are in the early conceptual phase, gathering feedback on these broad design principles. No vocabulary or grammar rules are set in stone yet.

## Getting Involved

We encourage you to contribute by sharing:

- Important concepts or culturally significant terms from your own language.
- Suggestions on inclusive terminology and potential biases to avoid.
- Ideas for structuring future collaboration and community decision-making.
- Contributions to documentation, including translations that expand our global reach.

Please open new issues or submit pull requests with your thoughts.

## Next Steps

Based on community input, our next steps will include:

- Drafting a core vocabulary.
- Proposing initial phonemic spelling and pronunciation rules.
- Developing processes for ongoing contributions and decision-making.
- Translating key documents and launching multilingual discussion forums.

Our goal is to create the most globally inclusive language possible.

Mata tu soda diki,

Kora mova siente.
(koh-rah moh-vah syen-teh)

Sol de luz calor,

Besa yo ena tu.

Kora mita fola,
(koh-rah mee-tah foh-lah)
Amor para siempre.
(ah-mor pah-rah siem-preh)

Heart Seeing (Translation)

My two eyes see sweet,
My heart feels movement.

Green leaf beautiful,
Child sweet pleasant,

Your spirit happy,
I feel happy.

Sun of warm light,
Kiss me in you.

Heart entwined leaf,
Love forever.
```
