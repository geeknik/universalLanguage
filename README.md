# Universal Language Project

This project aims to develop a constructed language that can serve as a universal means of communication worldwide. All are welcome to contribute!

## Design Goals

- Simplicity - Easy to learn and use for people of all ages and backgrounds
- Inclusiveness - Reflect concepts and terminology from all cultures and regions
- Evolving Vocabulary - Ability to incorporate new terms through community process
- Accessibility - Resources available in multiple languages to lower barriers

## Current Status

We are in the very early conceptual phase, soliciting initial feedback on broad design principles. No vocabulary or grammar rules are set yet.

## Getting Involved

Provide suggestions on:

- Important concepts/ideas to include from your culture or language
- Feedback on inclusive terminology
- Potential biases to avoid
- Ways to structure future collaboration
- Areas to prioritize as we develop alpha resources

You can also help by translating this initial documentation to other languages to expand our reach.

## Next Steps

Based on community input we will begin:

- Drafting core vocabulary concepts
- Proposing initial phonemic spelling and pronunciation rules
- Developing processes for ongoing contribution and decision making
- Translating key documents and launching multilingual discussion forums

Please open new issues with any other thoughts or questions as we refine this project together. Our goal is creating the most globally inclusive language possible!
